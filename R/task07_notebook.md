# Task 07 - R Notebook

##Introduction

This R Markdown Notebook has been created for as part of Task 06 for the course GEOL 590. This task is an introduction to using the **dplyr** package with the built-in datasets **nycflights13** and **babynames**.

##Assigned tasks

* Using the `nycflights13::weather`:
    * Determine whether there are any clear outliers in wind speed (`wind_speed`) that should be rejected. If so, filter those bad point(s) and proceed.
    * What direction has the highest median speed at each airport? Make a table and a plot of median wind speed by direction, for each airport. *Optional fun challenge: If you like, this is a rare opportunity to make use of `coord_polar()`.*

* Using `nycflights13::flights` and `nycflights13::airlines`:
    * Make a table with two columns: airline name (not carrier code) and median distance flown from JFK airport. The table should be arranged in order of decreasing mean flight distance. Hint: use a `_join` function to join `flights` and `airlines`.
    

```r
#Joins the flights and airlines datatables together so full airline names may be displayed
flights_and_airlines <- inner_join(flights, airlines, by = "carrier")

#Calculates the median distance of flights that leave from JFK by airline
median_dist_by_airline <- flights_and_airlines %>%
  select(name, origin, distance) %>%
  filter(origin == "JFK") %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(Median.Distance = median(distance)) %>%
  arrange(Median.Distance) %>%
  print()

* Make a *wide-format* data frame that displays the number of flights that leave Newark ("EWR") airport each month, from each airline


```r

#Calculates the number of flights that leave Newark each month by airline
num_flights_from_EWR <- flights_and_airlines %>%

  filter(origin == "EWR") %>%

## Using Number.of.flights as value column: use value.var to override.

* Using the **babynames** dataset:
    * Identify the ten most common male and female names in 2014. Make a plot of their frequency (`prop`) since 1880. (This may require two separate piped statements).
    
    * Make a single table of the 26th through 29th most common girls names in the year 1896, 1942, and 2016


```r

  head(n = 10)

#Joins the male and female most popular names of 2014
pop_names14 <- full_join(male_names14, female_names14)

The following is code for an interactive datatable of wind speed data from above. This was included to try to make a nicer looking table. The table will only display properly when looking at the html file:

```r
library(DT) #Loads the DT package which provides an R interface for the JavaScript library DataTables

#Creates a datatable of median wind speed data using the DT package
#This interactive datatable is only able to be seen when opening as an HTML file
datatable(median_wind_speed, class = "cell-border stripe", colnames = c("Airport", "Wind Direction", "Median Wind Speed (mph)"))
```
