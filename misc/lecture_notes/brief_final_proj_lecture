-What is an R package?
	-1 (or more) R function(s)
		-roxygen-type doc
	-Namespace file
	-Description file
	-Vignette
		-Rmd file explaining & demonstrating how to use package
		
-Data analysis project components:
	-Rmd file that implements and explains code
	-Code
		-> some functions
		
-Should be fairly easy to go between a data analysis project and an R package project since they have more or less the same components
-When building a package, can essentially start by doing data analysis, creating workflow, and later turning the data analysis into a vignette



Notes regarding our final project:
-One or several functions that import data
	-Convert to standard format, tidy dataframe
-Normalize however you want to standardize it
-Perform downstream analysis
