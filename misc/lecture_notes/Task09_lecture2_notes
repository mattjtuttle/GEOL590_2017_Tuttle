Workflow:

	RMD file --R code--> Markdown formatted results -> Markdown text + R output --pandoc--> HTML/PDF/DOCX/...


Vignettes:

	-About a certain package and is distributed with that package
	-Are essentially tutorials. Give big picture explanations of what packages are.
		-Vignettes are big picture while documentation is nuts and bolts.
	-Easily created with knitr
	
	-Packages need to be loaded in vignettes
	-Can directly integrate LaTeX code within the document. Really useful when including equations.
		-Use $ for in line code or fences as below:
			$$
			LaTeX code here
			$$

	browseVignettes()
		-can be used to look at vignettes of all installed packages
	
	devtools::useVignette()
		-Creates a skeleton of a markdown document that is able to be used to start documentation
		
		Note: devtools is used so that you do things the correct way. It is possible to get by without using devtools.

		
Unit testing:

	-Follows the philosophy that code should automatically and frequently test itself
	-Write code to test your own code
	
	Package: testthat
		-Runs every time that you build your package
		-Will give you warnings if things are not working
	
	devtools::use_testthat(pkg = "package")
	
	test_that()
		expect_equal()
		expect_error()
		expect_warning()
		
	devtools::check(pkg = "package")
		-Goes ahead and runs unit tests
	
	-In the description folder, other packages that the package is reliant on is included under "Suggestions:"
	-File name of testing files start with "test_"
	
	
Unrelated notes:

	coord_flip()
		-allows switching of dependent and independent variables on axes of graphs
