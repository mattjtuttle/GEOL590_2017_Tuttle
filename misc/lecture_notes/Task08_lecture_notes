-Functions are objects
-Loading a package loads a whole set of functions, datasets, and documentation
-R automatically returns whatever the last name thing is in a function
	-Can also call whatever you want to return at the end of teh function in curly brackets.
	-Avoid using the function "Return". Instead, just state whateverti is you would like returned.
-"source()" runs a file (can be a script or a function)
-Any information in a function you should directly pass to it in the form of an argument. Do not allow functions to pull data directly from the global environment.
-An "=" sets a parameter at its default value. Useful when there are options available but you know what arguments should probably be.
-"..." passes through arguments to another function? (a way to have an unspecified number of arguments?)
-"browser()" is a very useful function
	-allows you to work on the command line from that particular environment (e.g. you can see the order of packages being searched at a paricular location with "search()")

-Want to check to make sure that arguments that your function wants are in the correct format
	
	e.g.
	if(class(x) != "numeric") {
		stop("x is not a numeric vector")
		
	-Can issue a:
		-Message	"message()"
			-Most mild, just prints to the console
		-Warning	"warning()"
			-Prints a warning message to the console
		-Error		"stop()"
			-Forces the code to stop running and prints an error message
