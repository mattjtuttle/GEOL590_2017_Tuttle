----The R package shiny----
---------------------------

	-Used to create GUIs
	-To create: New project-> create a new shiny web application
	-The obvious use for shiny is to subset data in interesting ways

The "shinyex" directory:

	-absolutely necessary for server apps
	-"reactive programming"
	-Files in directory interact with one another
	
	Files in directory:
	
	1. server.R
		-Controls actual calculations. Does the math and runs R code
		-If you put code outside (before) the shinyServer() function, this code will run once when the shiny app actually loads
			-This is very helpful for loading libraries
		-To prevent long files, may want to create packages and functions that will perform the data analysis for the shiny app
		
	2. ui.R file
		-Defines how browser interface is laid out

Distribution of shiny apps:
	
	-Put it up on GitHub
	-Buy an Rstudio server (could also get free)
	-Run Rstudio on your own server
	-Use the website www.shinyapps.io
		-Limited run time per month
		
Notes:
-May be useful for displaying data in R package final project
-It would be great if you were able to build a shiny app that is able to built a script that correlates with what it is that you selected
